# SCF_MRJD_RS
In this project I aim to learn the basics of Rust and computation within Rust 
by implementing a progamme that can analyze the molecule geometry and run standard
HF SCF (maybe DFT) calculations. At the beginning I will follow the Crawford's group
tutorials on the subject. Later on I will try to implement the code myself.
