                             GENERAL INFORMATION
================================================================================
This programme was written by MRJD after finishing his Bachelor's in Chemistry 
at University of Regensburg and before starting his Master's at the LMU Munich. 
(Dec 2022 - Mar 2023) It was only written in his spare time and is not intended 
to be used for any serious calculations.
It was merely written to learn the Rust programming language and to get a better
understanding of the SCF / RHF / quantum chemical methodes.

The programme is written in Rust and is a "simple" (yet highly parallelized) 
implementation of the SCF method for the calculation of the ground state energy 
of a molecule for a given geometry. As of now, the programme can only calculate 
the energy of a molecule for "paired" electrons, which is called "RHF" for 
Restricted Hartree-Fock. No DFT-methods are implemented yet. 

A number of common basis sets are added to code. Because the author has written 
a parser for the Gaussian basis set format, it is possible to add any basis set 
to the code. As of now the following basis sets are implemented:

STO-3G, STO-6G, 6-311G*+, 6-311G*, 
def2-SVP, def2-TZVP and def2-QZVP. 

(Although this programme uses the McMurchie-Davidson algorithm to calculate the 
integrals, which utilizies the evaluation of Cartesian Gaussians, which 
may not conform to the definition of the def2-group basis-sets defined by Ahlrichs.)
